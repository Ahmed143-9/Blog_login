User Registration:

New users need to register first by providing their details (e.g., name, email, password).
The registration process ensures that users have a unique account on the platform.
After successful registration, users are directed to the login page.
User Login:

Registered users can log in by providing their email and password.
Upon successful login, users gain access to the dashboard where they can perform actions such as creating, editing, or deleting their blog posts.
Uploading a Blog Post:

After logging in, users can upload their own blog posts.
This includes entering the blog title, body content, and any necessary metadata (tags, categories, etc.).
Users can format the post, add images, and submit it.
After submission, the blog post is published and visible on the website for others to read.
Admin Panel (Optional):

An admin panel may be included to allow an administrator to review and approve posts before they are visible to other users.
Admins can also manage users and monitor the websiteâ€™s content.
